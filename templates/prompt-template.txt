# Monorepo Documentation Task

I need you to help document the following directories in my monorepo by:
1. Creating a README.md file in each directory
2. Updating the crmbl-map.json file with metadata about each directory

## New Directories to Document

{{NEW_DIRS}}

## Instructions

For each directory above, please:

1. **Analyze the directory contents** to understand:
   - What is the purpose of this directory?
   - What are the key files and their roles?
   - What dependencies does it have (internal and external)?
   - What is the complexity level (1-5)?
   - How frequently does it change?

2. **Create a README.md** in each directory with:
   - Clear purpose statement
   - Complexity score (1-5) with justification
   - Change frequency (Stable/Moderate/Frequently Modified)
   - List of key files with descriptions
   - Dependencies (both internal paths and external npm packages)
   - Entry points for the code
   - Any important architectural notes

3. **Update crmbl-map.json** with a new entry for each directory following this schema:

```json
{
  "/path/to/directory": {
    "purpose": "Brief description of what this directory does",
    "complexity": 1-5,
    "changeFrequency": "Stable|Moderate|Frequently Modified",
    "entryPoints": ["main.ts", "index.ts"],
    "internalDeps": ["/other/directory/path"],
    "externalDeps": ["package-name"],
    "readmePath": "/path/to/directory/README.md",
    "keyFiles": [
      {"file": "filename.ts", "description": "What it does"}
    ],
    "subdirectories": ["/path/to/subdirs"],
    "lastUpdated": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
  }
}
```

## Current Configuration

- Root path: {{ROOT_PATH}}
- Output file: {{OUTPUT_PATH}}
- Total new directories: {{TOTAL_NEW}}

## Template Reference

You can use this template structure for the READMEs:

```markdown
# [Directory Name]

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Purpose
[Description]

## Complexity Score
**[1-5]/5** - [Justification]

## Change Frequency
**[Stable|Moderate|Frequently Modified]**

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `file.ts` | Description |

## Entry Points
- List entry point files

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `/path` - Description

### External Dependencies
- `package` - Description

## Architecture Notes
[Notes about patterns, decisions, gotchas]
```

Please be thorough and accurate in your documentation. Focus on providing useful context that will help other AI agents navigate this codebase efficiently.
